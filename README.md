in this project I'm learning about object oriented programming in python

yet I have much to understandso this repository will be continuosly updated as I fuck around and find out

this project is about a veterinary clinc in which animals comes in and out as time goes by

so at the start of the program random n pets will be in and as time goes by some will be discharged and others admitted in

ths program will serve as practice for the project of software engeneering that I'm a part in
(https://github.com/ALBERTOFFFEN/Progetto_Ingegneria) -> once terminated I'll add it to my profile too
and also will serve as a good base for the project Eclipse
